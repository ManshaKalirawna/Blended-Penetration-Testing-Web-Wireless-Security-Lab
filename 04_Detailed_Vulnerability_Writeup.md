Detailed Vulnerability Write-Up

This section documents each confirmed vulnerability identified during the security assessment of the OWASP Juice Shop web application. For every issue, I’ve included the testing steps I performed, the evidence I collected, and an explanation of why the vulnerability matters from both a security and business perspective. Screenshots are linked below.

4.1 SQL Injection (High Severity)
Overview

During testing, I found that several user-input fields—particularly the search bar and the login form—did not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data. This allowed me to inject SQL queries into the backend database.

Testing Steps

1. Navigated to the login page.

2 Entered a basic SQL payload into the username field:

 ' OR '1'='1

3. Submitted the login form without providing a valid password.

4. The application responded with a successful authentication message.

Impact

1. Bypassing authentication without valid credentials

2. Possible exposure of user account data

3. Risk of full database compromise

4.2 Broken Authentication – Weak Default Password (High Severity)
Overview

The administrator account still used its default credentials. I could log in as the admin using these default passwords.

Testing Steps

1. Navigated to the admin login page.

2. Entered default username/password combinations.

3. The application displayed a pop-up confirming successful admin login.

Impact

1. Full system compromise possible

2. Administrative access exposes all sensitive data

4.3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Reflected (Medium Severity)
Overview

Reflected XSS was discovered in the search bar and other fields where input is reflected back without proper sanitization.

Testing Steps

1. Inserted this payload in a search field:

<script>alert('XSS Test');</script>

2. The alert executed immediately upon page reload.

Impact

1. Session hijacking

2. Credential theft

3. Redirection to malicious websites

4.4 Open Redirect (Medium Severity)
Overview

Users could be redirected to arbitrary external sites via URL parameters.

Testing Steps

1. Opened the redirect URL on the Juice Shop instance:

http://<your-ip>:3000/redirect?to=https://blockchain.info/address/1AbKfgvw9psQ41NbLi8kufDQTezwG8DRZm

2. Observed the redirect and pop-up confirming the challenge solved.

Impact

1. Users can be redirected to malicious sites

2. Could be used in phishing attacks

4.5 Security Misconfiguration – Exposed API / Debug Info (Medium Severity)
Overview

Accessible directories and endpoints exposed information about the application and products without authentication.

Testing Steps

1. Used manual exploration of /api/products and /debug/ endpoints

2. Observed sensitive information returned in JSON format

Impact

1. Information disclosure increases attack surface

2. Could help attackers craft further attacks

4.6 Input Validation Issues (Low Severity)
Overview

During testing, I observed that several input fields, particularly the search bar, accepted unusual and unexpected characters without proper validation. While the application correctly displayed "No results found" when the input did not match any products, it still echoed the entire user input on the page. This behavior indicates weak input validation.

Testing Steps

1. Navigated to the search bar on the Juice Shop main page.

2. Entered a mixture of special characters, symbols, and a long string:

!@#$%^&*()_+{}[]:";'<>?/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

3. Pressed Enter to submit the search.

4. Observed that the page displayed "No results found," but the exact input was printed on the page in bold.

Impact

1. Shows that the application does not properly validate user input.

2. Could increase the likelihood of future injection or XSS vulnerabilities if other parts of the application use this input unsafely.

3. Demonstrates a minor security misconfiguration in input handling.
